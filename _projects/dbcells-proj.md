title: "DBCells - an architecture for publishing linked modelling data"
excerpt: "Land change models require large amounts of data, and are difficult to be reproduced, as well as to be reused. Some initiatives to open and link data increase the reproducibility of scientific experiments and data reuse. One pillar of the linked data concept is the use of Uniform Resource Identifier (URI). In this paper, we propose DBCells – an architecture for publication of a global cellular space where each cell has a URI. This new approach will allow comparison, reproduction and the reuse of models and data (www.dbcells.org)."
