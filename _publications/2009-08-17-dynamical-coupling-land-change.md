excerpt: 'No single model or scale can fully capture
the causes of land change. For a given region, land
changes may have different impacts at different
places. Limits and opportunities imposed by biophysical and socio-economic conditions, such as local
policies and accessibility, may induce distinct land
change trajectories. These local land change trajecto-
ries may, in turn, indirectly affect other places, as
local actions interact with higher-level driving forces.
Such intraregional interdependencies cannot be captured by studies at a single scale, calling for multiscale'
