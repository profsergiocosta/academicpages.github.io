title: "Migrating geoprocessing routines to web services for water resource management applications"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2011-extracting-evolution-landcover
excerpt: 'Spatial data infrastructures are beginning to support the most common requirements of spatial
information users---discovery, access, and visual overlay of datasets-- however specialized users such
as hydrological scientists require more advanced services for capturing, analyzing and processing
huge volumes of data. To help migrate these scientists from desktop GIS to on-line service-data
offers, we describe an approach to model and develop distributed geoprocessing services for water
resource management applications built on top of basic SDI functionality.. We illustrate a GMES-
funded scenario for predicting runoff in Alpine basins employing a framework which may serve to
easily extrapolate our experiences to other specialized application fields like environmental and
climate change applications.'
