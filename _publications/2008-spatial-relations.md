title: "Spatial relations across scales in land change models"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2008-spatial-relations
excerpt: 'Land changes are the result of a complex web of interaction between
human and biophysical factors, which act over a wide range of temporal and
spatial scales. In this paper we conceptualize spatial relations among
geographic objects at different scales. We analyze two types of spatial
relations: hierarchical, which handles the interaction of nested objects at
different scales (countries, states and municipalities, for example); and a
network-based relation, which handles action-at-a-distance types of
interaction (market chains, for instance) of objects at different scales (such as
farms in Central Amazonia to soybean market consumers at the global scale).
We implemented such relations in the Terralib environment, in which they can
be constructed using selected strategies, and then used in dynamic models. We
exemplify the use of such concepts in a real-world case study in the Brazilian
Amazonia. We conclude that combining hierarchical and network-based
spatial relations provide a comprehensive conceptual framework to include
top-down and bottom-up interactions and feedbacks in multi-scale land-
change models.'
