collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2011-extracting-evolution-landcover
excerpt: 'We live in a changing world and this acceleration of changes provides a strong motivation for research in GeoInformatics. Our tools and methods for representing and handling land cover data should be capable of dealing with change. Int this work we developed a land cover model to handle the evolution of land cover objects. This consist of an abstract data type and uses a limited number of spatial operations such as create and split to elict the changes is suffers in time. We present an application of the model to the data provide by Brazilian Amazon Deforestation Monitoring Program.'
