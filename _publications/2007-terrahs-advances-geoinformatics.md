title: "TerraHS: Integration of Functional Programming and Spatial Databases for GIS Application Development"

excerpt: 'Recently, researchers in GIScience argued about the benefits on using functional programming for geospatial application development and prototyping of novel ideas. This paper presents an application that interfaces a functional language with a spatial database. It enables developing GIS
applications development in a functional language, while handling data are in a spatial database. We used this application develop a Map Algebra, that shows the benefits on using this paradigm in GIScience. Our work shows there are many gains in using a functional language, especially Haskell, to write concise and expressive GIS applications. The TerraHS application allows a good compromise between the expressive power of a functional language, and the data handling facilities of an imperative language.'
