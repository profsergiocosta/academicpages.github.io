excerpt: 'Land change models require large amounts of data, and are diffi cult to be reproduced, as well as to be reused. Some
initiatives to open and link data increase the reproducibility of scientifi c experiments and data reuse. One pillar of the
linked data concept is the use of Uniform Resource Identifi er (URI). In this paper, we propose DBCells â€“ an architecture
for publication of a global cellular space where each cell has a URI. This new approach will allow comparison,
reproduction and the reuse of models and data. However, in order to succeed, this proposal requires participation,
partnerships and investments. The main purpose of this paper is to present the architecture, benefi ts and challenges for
debating with the scientifi c community'
